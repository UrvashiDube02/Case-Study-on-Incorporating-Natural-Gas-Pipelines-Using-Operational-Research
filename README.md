# Case-Study-on-Incorporating-Natural-Gas-Pipelines-Using-Operational-Research

**Background**

<p align = "justify">
In 2018, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)
faced challenges due to the increasing demand for
natural gas. To expand efficiently, they adopted
Operations Research with linear optimization, leading to
higher profits and reduced infrastructure repair costs.
The method optimized complex transportation processes
affected by varying temperature and pressure, ensuring a
steady gas supply. CNPC'
s success demonstrates the
power of innovation in the natural gas industry.</p>
